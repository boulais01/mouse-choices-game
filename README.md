# mouse-choices-game
The narrative game in which the mouse tracker is implemented.

This repository houses a narrative game written in Twine's Sugarcube format, v2.34.1. This narrative game
also includes a mouse tracker that runs on the initialization of each passage, and at the end screen of
the game is the option to download all of the mouse movements as well as a variety of details pertaining
to the final state of the variables within the game. This information is downloaded as JSON files, and is
discarded if it is note downloaded.

The narrative game can be run by double clicking the file within a local file explorer or otherwise opening
it with a browser.
